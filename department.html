           <hr color="black"> <h3 style="text-align: center;">  ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h3><hr>
   <p style="text-align: center;">The Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department began in 2010 with 60 students in its undergraduate program. By that same year, we expanded to accommodate 180 students. In 2014, we introduced a Master's program in CSE, starting with 18 students. Our department is also a recognized research center under Anna University, supporting over 50 research scholars in various fields. Currently, we serve over 900 students across undergraduate, postgraduate, and Ph.D. programs.
In just ten years, our department has achieved many milestones. We now have 50 faculty members, each an expert in different areas of computer science. Half of them have Ph.D. degrees, and many others are working towards them. We're proud that three faculty members have completed postdoctoral fellowships at international universities. Our faculty contribute through publications in journals, research articles, and conference presentations.</p>
